## Migrating to Foundry V1

Foundry V1 is the blazing-fast smart contract testing framework you already know, but finally marked as stable and respecting semver. It's the culmination of over a year of work and more than 200 contributors that chimed in to make it happen.

With the V1 release, some breaking changes have been made which might require you to tweak your tests, and some patterns are now discouraged and might emit warnings. This guide will help you understand what these changes are and how to handle them properly.
